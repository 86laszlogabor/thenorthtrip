      <h2>What you are actually buying</h2>
      <p>
        CDW does not mean zero risk. It limits liability, but excess still applies.
        The number that matters is the excess, not the marketing label.
      </p>

      <h2>CDW vs Super CDW</h2>
      <p>
        Super CDW reduces the excess. In Finland, this often makes sense if you want
        predictable worst-case cost, especially in winter conditions.
      </p>

      <h2>The three questions that save money</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>What is the excess amount?</li>
        <li>What damage is excluded (tires, glass, underbody)?</li>
        <li>Who handles claims and what proof is required?</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Insurance is liability clarity, not peace-of-mind marketing.</p>

      <h2>Winter camper reality</h2>
      <p>
        Heating, batteries, water systems, and short daylight change everything.
        Winter camper travel is possible, but not cheap or effortless.
      </p>

      <h2>Who this is for</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Experienced campers</li>
        <li>Flexible itineraries</li>
        <li>People who value experience over savings</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Winter campers are a lifestyle choice, not a budget hack.</p>

      <h2>Rovaniemi</h2>
      <p>Best logistics. More crowds.</p>

      <h2>Levi</h2>
      <p>Resort comfort. Higher prices.</p>

      <h2>Ylläs</h2>
      <p>Quiet, nature-first. Car recommended.</p>

      <p><strong>Decision shortcut:</strong> Convenience → Rovaniemi. Ski comfort → Levi. Silence → Ylläs.</p>

  "lapland-tours-whats-included-vs-whats-quietly-extra": (
    <>
      <h2>Included rarely means complete</h2>
      <p>
        Gear, photos, food, and transfers are often extra. Compare tours by what is
        not included first.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Cheap tours often become average-priced at checkout.</p>

  "lapland-road-trip-costs-a-realistic-7-day-example": (
    <>
      <h2>Realistic cost range</h2>
      <p>
        A 7-day Lapland road trip for two usually lands between €2,300 and €3,900
        once you include accommodation, fuel, and activities.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Lapland is expensive, but predictable when planned honestly.</p>

  "finland-winter-driving-add-ons-what-you-actually-need": (
    <>
      <h2>What matters</h2>
      <p>
        Winter tires are mandatory. Many winter bundles are upsell fluff.
        Focus on excess and excluded damage categories.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Pay for safety, not accessories.</p>

      <h2>Debit card reality</h2>
      <p>
        Debit cards sometimes work in Finland. At airports, they often do not.
        Verify with the operator before booking.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Do not gamble your trip on a debit card.</p>

  "helsinki-airport-car-rental-credit-card-deposit-hold-what-actually-happens": (
    <>
      <h2>What a deposit hold is</h2>
      <p>
        A deposit hold is a temporary authorization, not a charge. At Helsinki Airport,
        it is standard even if you paid online.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Plan available credit, not just rental price.</p>
